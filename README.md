# Codepen Desktop Landing Page Clone

## Overview
I created this clone of Codepen's desktop landing page for my final project in the Code to Success 2022 summer bootcamp. This helped me solidfy my knowledge of HTML and CSS that I had learned throughout the bootcamp. Currently, this project is not mobile-responsive and is instead based off a desktop version of a prior Codepen landing page.
